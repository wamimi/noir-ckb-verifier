# Private tally v2 setup ceremony

**Open.** Contributions are made one at a time; see the [contributor guide](../../docs/setup-ceremony.md).

Every key below was checked with `snarkjs zkey verify` against the frozen
circuit and the phase 1 file before it was accepted. Anyone can repeat the whole
check: `python3 -B scripts/ceremony-private-tally.py check` (or the manual
commands in the [contributor guide](../../docs/setup-ceremony.md#verifying-the-ceremony-yourself)).

This is a public ceremony for a testnet developer preview, not an audited
production ceremony. It guarantees that nobody can forge private tally proofs as
long as at least one contributor's randomness was discarded.
